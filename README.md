# VulnyModel
This repository contains webui code to generate datasets for a Vulnerability Detection Model based on previous output.

**Reinforcement Learning**
- as a Disclaimer this is not the best RL Approach as you should have your own RLAgent implemented in your Model to perform RL with rewards and penalities in runtime as this is used to manually verify the output and accuracy for debugging purposes.

**Quick-Start**
